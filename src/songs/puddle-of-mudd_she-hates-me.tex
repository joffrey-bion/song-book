\begin{Verse}
Met a girl, thought she was grand
Fell in love, found out first hand
Went well for a week or two
Then it all came unglued
\end{Verse}

\begin{PreChorus}
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie
\end{PreChorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
She fucking hates me
Trust
She fucking hates me
La la la love
I tried too hard
And she tore my feelings like I had none
And ripped them away
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
She was queen for about an hour
After that shit got sour
She took all I ever had
No sign of guilt
No feeling of bad, no
\end{Verse}

\begin{PreChorus}
In a trap, trip I can't grip
Never thought I'd be the one who'd slip
Then I started to realize
I was living one big lie

\begin{Verse}
That's my story, as you see
Learned my lesson and so did she
Now it's over and I'm glad
'cause I'm a fool for all I've said

La la la la la la la la la love

And she tore my feelings like I had none
She fucking hates me

\begin{Verse}
Robert's got a quick hand
He'll look around the room
He wont tell you his plan
He's got a rolled cigarette
Hanging out his mouth
He's a cowboy kid
\espaceInterStrophe

Yeah! He found a six-shooter gun
In his dad's closet,
With the box of fun things
I don't even know what,
But he's coming for you
Yeah, he's coming for you
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks,
You better run, better run
Outrun my gun
All the other kids with the pumped up kicks,
You better run, better run
Faster than my bullet

\begin{Verse}
Daddy works a long day
He be coming home late,
and he's coming home late
And he's bringing me a surprise
'cause dinner's in the kitchen
and it's packed in ice
\espaceInterStrophe

I've waited for a long time
Yeah the sleight of my hand
Is now a quick-pull trigger
I reason with my cigarette,
Then say, "Your hair's on fire,
you must have lost your wits, yeah?"

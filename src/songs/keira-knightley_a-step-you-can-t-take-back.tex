\begin{Song}{A Step You Can't Take Back}{Keira Knightley}
\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{Verse}
So you find yourself at this subway
With your world in a bag by your side
And all at once it seemed like a good way
You realize it's the end of the line
For what it's worth
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Here comes the train upon the track
And there goes the pain, it cuts to black
Are you ready for the last act
To take a step you can't take back
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Taken all the punches you could take
Took 'em all right on the chest
Now the camel's back is breaking
Again, again
For what it's worth
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Here comes the train upon the track
And there goes the pain, it cuts to black
Are you ready for the last act
To take a step you can't take back
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Bridge}
Did she love you
Did she take you down
Was she on her knees
When she kissed your crown
Tell me what you found
\end{Bridge}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Here comes the rain, so hold your hat
And don't pray to God
'cause He won't talk back
Are you ready for the last act
To take a step you can't take back, back, back
You can't take back, back, back
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
So you find yourself at this subway
With your world in a bag by your side

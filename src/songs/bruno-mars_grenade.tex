\begin{Verse}
Easy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all
But you never give
Should've known you was trouble
From the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{PreChorus}
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...
\end{PreChorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I'd catch a grenade for you
\backup{yeah, yeah, yeah}
Throw my hand on a blade for you
\backup{yeah, yeah, yeah}
I'd jump in front of a train for you
\backup{yeah, yeah, yeah}
You know I'd do anything for you
\backup{yeah, yeah, yeah}
Oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby
But you won't do the same
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "Hey"
When you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman
That's just what you are
Yeah, you smile in my face
Then rip the brakes out my car
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{PreChorus}
Gave you all I had
And you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
'Cause what you don't understand is...

\begin{Bridge}
If my body was on fire
Oh, you watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never ever ever did, baby

But, darling, I'd still catch a grenade for you

No, you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you'd never do the same
Oh, no no no

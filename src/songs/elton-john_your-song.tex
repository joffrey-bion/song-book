\begin{Verse}
It's a little bit funny this feeling inside
I'm not one of those who can easily hide
I don't have much money but boy if I did
I'd buy a big house where we both could live
\espaceInterStrophe

If I was a sculptor, but then again, no
Or a man who makes potions in a travelling show
I know it's not much but it's the best I can do
My gift is my song and this one's for you
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
I sat on the roof and kicked off the moss
Well a few of the verses, they've got me quite cross
But the sun's been quite kind while I wrote this song
It's for people like you that keep it turned on
\espaceInterStrophe

So excuse me forgetting but these things I do
You see I've forgotten if they're green or they're blue
Anyway the thing is what I really mean
Yours are the sweetest eyes I've ever seen
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
And you can tell everybody this is your song
It may be quite simple but now that it's done
I hope you don't mind
I hope you don't mind
That I put down in words
How wonderful life is
While you're in the world
\end{Chorus}

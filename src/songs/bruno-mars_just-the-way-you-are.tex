\begin{Song}{Just the Way You Are}{Bruno Mars}
\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{Verse}
Oh, her eyes, her eyes
Make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
\espaceInterStrophe

Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me "Do I look okay?"
I say
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
\espaceInterStrophe

And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Her lips, her lips
I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh, her laugh
She hates but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her everyday
\espaceInterStrophe

Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
\end{Verse}

\begin{Song}{Animal Instinct}[Cranberries]{The Cranberries}

\begin{multicols}{2}
\begin{Verse}
Suddenly something has happened to me
As I was having my cup of tea
Suddenly I was feeling depressed
I was utterly and totally stressed
Do you know you made me cry
Do you know you made me die
\end{Verse}

\begin{PreChorus}
And the thing that gets to me
Is you’ll never really see
And the thing that freaks me out
Is I’ll always be in doubt
\end{PreChorus}

\begin{Chorus}
It is a lovely thing that we have
It is a lovely thing that we
It is a lovely thing, the animal
The animal instinct
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
So take my hands and come with me
We will change reality
So take my hands and we will pray
They won’t take you away
They will never make me cry, no
They will never make me die
\end{Verse}

And the thing that gets to me
Is you’ll never really see
And the thing that freaks me out
Is I’ll always be in doubt

\begin{Chorus}
The animal, the animal,
The animal instinct in me
It’s the animal, the animal,
The animal instinct in me
It’s the animal, it’s the animal,
It’s the animal instinct in me
It’s the animal, it’s the animal,
It’s the animal instinct in me

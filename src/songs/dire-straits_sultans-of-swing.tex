\begin{Song}{Sultans of Swing}{Dire Straits}
\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{Verse}
You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park but meantime
South of the river you stop
And you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie double four time
You feel alright when you hear that music ring
\espaceInterStrophe

And now ou step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain
To hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns ain't blowing that sound
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Way on downsouth\dots
Way on downsouth London town
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
You check out Guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind he's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
And an old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing
\vfill
\columnbreak

And Harry doesn't mind
If he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job
He's doing alright
He can play honky tonk just like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
With the Sultans\dots
With the Sultans of Swing
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed
In their best brown baggies and their platform soles
The don't give a damn about any trumpet \rejet{playing band}
It ain't what they call rock and roll
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
And the Sultans\dots
And the Sultans played Creole
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
'Thank you goodnight now it's time to go home'
And he makes it fast whith one more thing
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
'We are the Sultans\dots
We are the Sultans of Swing'
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
I'm Stain
My name is Stain, I don't complain
I won't complain, do you comprend
What is the point of being born
And being gone, there must be a reason

What we do best is sharing guns
And kill for fun, there must be a reason

He gamme such a name cause stains they all mix together

The best to do is to give some comprend

And take my hand, you take my hand
So world it needs to shine again

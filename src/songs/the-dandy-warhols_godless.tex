\begin{Song}{Godless}[Dandy Warhols]{The Dandy Warhols}

\begin{Verse}
Hey I said you're godless and
It seems like you're a souless friend
As spotless as you were back then
I swear that you are godless
\espaceInterStrophe

Hey I guess you're lonely when
I gave you all it took so then
A stranger there is ever been
I guess, it's what you wanted

But this is all that I have gotten

\begin{Verse}
Hey as for the day my friend
To hope that you could ever bend
I swear you are, I swear you are
I swear, that you are godless
\espaceInterStrophe

Hey I said you're godless, yeah
Hey and you're a souless friend
Hey I said you're heartless
And I swear, I swear\dots

Godless, godless,
Gooo\dots\ you're godless

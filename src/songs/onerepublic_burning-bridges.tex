\begin{Verse}
You and I were meant to be
Ain't no doubt about it
No way to hide that sort of thing
Now I’m waiting for something better
Ain't nothing better worth imagining
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I, I keep on running
I’m building bridges
That I know you never wanted
Look for my heart
You stole it away
Now on every single road that I could take
Listen, I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on Fire
You set me
Set me on Fire
You can burn my bridges down
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Send this out to sea
Send it where you wanted
You can take your no for no or not at all
There’s no filling up your spaces
With fictionary places, imaginary faces
They don’t work at all
\end{Verse}

\begin{Chorus}
I want you to burn my bridges down, down
I want you to burn my bridges down
Set me on fire
You set me
Set me on Fire
Set me on Fire
I want you to burn my bridges down
I said, I want you to burn my bridges down
Down, Down
Set me on fire
Set me on fire
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Here come old flattop, he come grooving up slowly
He got joo-joo eyeball, he one holy roller
He got hair down to his knee
Got to be a joker he just do what he please
\espaceInterStrophe

He wear no shoeshine, he got toe-jam football
He got monkey finger, he shoot Coca-Cola
He say, "I know you, you know me."
One thing I can tell you is you got to be free
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Come together right now over me
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
He bag production, he got walrus gumboot
He got Ono sideboard, he one spinal cracker
He got feet down below his knee
Hold you in his armchair you can feel his disease
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Come together right now over me
\espaceInterStrophe

Right!
Come, oh, come, come, come.)
\end{Chorus}
\columnbreak

\begin{Verse}
He roller-coaster, he got early warning
He got muddy water, he one mojo filter
He say, "One and one, and one is three."
Got to be good-looking 'cause he's so hard to see
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Come together right now over me
\espaceInterStrophe

Oh
Come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, come together
Yeah, oh
Come together
Yeah, come together
\end{Chorus}

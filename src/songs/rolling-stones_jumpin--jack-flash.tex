\begin{Song}{Jumpin' Jack Flash}[Rolling Stones]{The Rolling Stones}

\begin{Verse}
Watch it!
\espaceInterStrophe

I was born in a crossfire hurricane
And I howled at my ma in the driving rain
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
But it's all right now
In fact it's a gas
But it's all right
I'm Jumpin' Jack Flash, it's a gas, gas, gas
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
I was raised by a toothless, bearded hag
I was schooled with a strap right across my back
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
I was drowned, I was washed up and left for dead
I fell down, to my feet and I saw they bled
\espaceInterStrophe

Yeah, sure and I frowned at the crumbs of a crust of bread, sure
Yeah, I was crowned with a spike right through my head
\end{Verse}

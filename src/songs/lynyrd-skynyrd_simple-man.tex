\begin{Verse}
Mama told me when I was young
Come sit beside me, my only son
And listen closely to what I say
And if you do this
It'll help you some sunny day
\espaceInterStrophe

Oh, take your time, don't live too fast
Troubles will come and they will pass
You'll find a woman, yea yea, you'll find love
And don't forget son
There is someone up above
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
And be a simple kind of man
Oh be something you love and understand
Baby be a simple kind of man
Oh, won't you do this for me son if you can?
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Forget your lust for the rich man's gold
All that you need is in your soul
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you my son
Is to be satisfied

Boy, don't you worry... you'll find yourself
Follow your heart, lord, and nothing else
And you can do this, oh baby, if you try
All that I want for you my son,
Is to be satisfied

\begin{Verse}
I'll sing it one last time for you
Then we really have to go
You've been the only thing that's right
In all I've done
\espaceInterStrophe

And I can barely look at you
But every single time I do
I know we'll make it anywhere
Away from here
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear
\espaceInterStrophe

Louder louder
And we'll run for our lives
I can hardly speak I understand
Why you can't raise your voice to say
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
To think I might not see those eyes
Makes it so hard not to cry
And as we say our long goodbye
I nearly do
\end{Verse}

\begin{Chorus}
Slower slower
We don't have time for that
All I want's to find an easy way
To get out of our little heads
\espaceInterStrophe

Have heart, my dear
We're bound to be afraid
Even if it's just for a few days
Making up for all this mess
\espaceInterStrophe

Light up, light up
As if you have a choice
Even if you cannot hear my voice
I'll be right beside you dear
\end{Chorus}

\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{Verse}
So betterman I am since I
Come into contact with you
And you taught so many things about myself
And you know this is true
But now we are apart and it is all my fault
'Cause you know I need to be alone
Don't know myself
So why can I share me with you girl or anyone
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Don't want to be a thorn in your side
Good woman
Always be the one to make you cry
Don't wanna be that guy
Good woman
'Cause you deserve everything
And I got nothing so leave me
And I'll go away, better off I stay
Far from you you you you you
'Cause you are beautiful
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Now typical man I am because you think
I want my cake and eat it too
'Cause I can't be in no relationship
But I still feel for you
'Cause you are the greatest woman
This old man has ever met
You taught me about my soul
You shared with me your magic

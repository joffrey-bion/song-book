\begin{Verse}
Is there anybody going
To listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much
It makes you sorry
Still you don't regret a single day
\end{Verse}

\begin{Chorus}
Ah girl, girl\dots
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
When I think of all the times
I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the earth to me
And I believe her
After all this time I don't know why

\begin{Bridge}
She's the kind of girl who puts you down
When friends are there, you feel
A fool
When you say she's looking good
She acts as if it's understood
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh\dots
\end{Bridge}

Ah girl, girl\dots

\begin{Verse}
Was she told when she was young
That pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back
To earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?

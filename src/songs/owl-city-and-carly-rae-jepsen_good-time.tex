\begin{Verse}
Woke up on the right side of the bed
What's up with this Prince song inside my head?
Hands up if you're down to get down tonight
'Cuz it's always a good time
\espaceInterStrophe

Slept in all my clothes like I didn't care
Hopped into a cab, take me anywhere
I'm in if you're down to get down tonight
'Cuz it's always a good time
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{PreChorus}
Good morning and good night
I wake up at twilight
It's gonna be alright
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
\end{PreChorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
It's always a good time
Woah-oh-oh-oh Woah-oh-oh-oh
We don't even have to try
It's always a good time
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Freaked out, dropped my phone in the pool again
Checked out of my room hit the ATM
Let's hang out if you're down to get down tonight
'Cuz it's always a good time
\end{Verse}

Good morning and good night

Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then
Doesn't matter where
It's always a good time there
Doesn't matter when
It's always a good time then

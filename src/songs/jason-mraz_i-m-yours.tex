\begin{Song}{I'm Yours}{Jason Mraz}
\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{Verse}
Well you've done done me and you bet I felt it
I tried to be chill but you're so hot that I melted
I fell right through the cracks
and now I'm trying to get back
\espaceInterStrophe

Before the cool done run out
I'll be giving it my bestest
Nothing's going to stop me but divine intervention
I reckon it's again my turn
To win some or learn some
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and then you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find
Love love love love
\espaceInterStrophe

Listen to the music of the moment people dance
And sing, we're just one big family
It's our God-forsaken right to be
Loved loved loved loved loooved
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
So I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm sure
There's no need to complicate
Our time is short
This is our fate, I'm yours
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Do you want to, come on, scootch over closer dear
And I will nibble your ear
\espaceInterStrophe

I've been spending way too long
Checking my tongue in the mirror
And bending over backwards
Just to try to see it clearer
But my breath fogged up the glass
And so I drew a new face and I laughed
\espaceInterStrophe

I guess what I'll be saying is
There ain't no better reason
To rid yourself of vanities
And just go with the seasons
It's what we aim to do
Our name is our virtue
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
But I won't hesitate no more, no more
It cannot wait, I'm yours
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Well open up your mind and see like me
Open up your plans and then you're free
Look into your heart and you'll find that
The sky is yours
\espaceInterStrophe

So please don't, please don't, please don't.
There's no need to complicate
'cause our time is short
This oh, this oh, this is our fate, I'm yours
\end{Verse}

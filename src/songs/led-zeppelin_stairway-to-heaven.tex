\begin{Verse}
There's a lady who's sure all that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
When she gets there she knows if the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
\espaceInterStrophe

Woe oh oh oh oh oh
And she's buying a stairway to heaven
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
There's a sign on the wall but she wants to be sure
And you know sometimes words have two meanings
In the tree by the brook there's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven

\begin{Chorus}
And it makes me wonder Oh oh
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
There's a feeling I get when I look to the west
And my spirit is crying for leaving
In my thoughts I have seen rings of smoke through the trees
And the voices of those who stand looking
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Oh it makes me wonder
Oh And it makes me wonder
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
And it's whispered that soon, if we all call the tune
Then the piper will lead us to reason
And a new day will dawn for those who stand long
And the forest will echo with laughter
\espaceInterStrophe

Oooouuuh oh oh
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed now
It's just a spring clean for the May Queen
Yes there are two paths you can go by
but in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
Oh it makes me wonder
Oooouuuh oh oh
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Your head is humming and it won't go
Because you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady can't you hear the wind blow
And did you know
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind
\end{Verse}

\begin{Bridge}
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
Woe oh oh oh oh oh
\end{Bridge}

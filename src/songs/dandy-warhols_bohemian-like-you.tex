\begin{Verse}
So what do you do?
Oh yeah I wait tables too
No, I haven't heard your band
Cause you guys are pretty new
But if you dig
On vegan food
Well come over to my work
I'll have em cook you something that you really love
\end{Verse}

\begin{Verse}
Wait, who's that guy?
Just hangin' at your pad
He's lookin kinda bummed
Yeah, you broke up that's too bad
I guess it's fair
If he always pays the rent
And he doesn't get bent
About sleepin' on the couch when I'm there
\end{Verse}

And I'm feelin so bohemian like you
It's you that I want so please
Just a casual, casual easy thing
If it isn't, it is for me

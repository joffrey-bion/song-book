\begin{Song}[Horse With No Name]{A Horse With No Name}{America}

\begin{Verse}
On the first part of the journey
I was looking at all the life
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
\espaceInterStrophe

The first thing I met, was a fly with a buzz
And the sky, with no clouds
The heat was hot, and the ground was dry
But the air was full of sound
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I've been through the desert on a horse with no name
It felt good to be out of the rain
In the desert, you can remember your name
'Cause there ain't no one for to give you no pain
La, laaa, laaa, la la, la la, la la la, la, laaa, la
La, laaa, laaa, la la, la la, la la la, la, laaa, la
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
After two days, in the desert sun
My skin began to turn red
After three days, in the desert fun
I was looking at a river bed
And the story it told of a river that flowed
Made me sad to think it was dead
\end{Verse}

\begin{Verse}
After nine days, I let the horse run free
'Cause the desert had turned to sea
There were plants and birds, and rocks and things
There was sand and hills and rings
\espaceInterStrophe

The ocean is a desert, with it's life underground
And a perfect disguise above
Under the cities lies, a heart made of ground
But the humans will give no love
\end{Verse}

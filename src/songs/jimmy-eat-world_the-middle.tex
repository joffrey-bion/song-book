\begin{Verse}
Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out
Or looked down on
\espaceInterStrophe

Just try your best
Try everything you can
And don't you worry what they tell themselves
When you're away
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
It just takes some time
Little girl you're in the middle of the ride
Everything \backup{everything} will be just fine
Everything \backup{everything} will be alright \backup{alright}
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
Hey, you know they're all the same
You know you're doing better on your own
So don't buy in
\espaceInterStrophe

Live right now
Yeah, just be yourself
It doesn't matter if it's good enough
For someone else.

Hey, don't write yourself off yet
It's only in your head you feel left out
Or looked down on
\espaceInterStrophe

Just do your best
Do everything you can
And don't you worry what the bitter hearts
Are gonna say

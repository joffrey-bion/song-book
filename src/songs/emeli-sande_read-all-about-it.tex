\begin{multicols}{2}

\begin{Verse}
You've got the words to change a Nation
But you're biting your tongue
You've spent a life time stuck in silence
Afraid you'll say something wrong
If no one ever hears it
How we gonna learn your song
\espaceInterStrophe

So come on, come on
Come on, come on
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
You've got a heart as loud as lions
So why let your voice be tamed
Maybe we're a little different
There's no need to be ashamed
You've got the light to fight the shadows
So stop hiding it away
\espaceInterStrophe

Come on, come oooon
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I wanna sing, I wanna shout
I wanna scream till the words dry out
So put it in all of the papers
I'm not afraid
They can read all about it
Read all about it, oh
oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh
oh-ooooh
oh-oh-oh
oh-oh-oh
oh-ooooh
\end{Chorus}

\begin{Verse}
At night we're waking up the neighbors
While we sing away the blues
Making sure that we're remembered
Yeah, cause we all matter too
If the truth has been forbidden
Then we're breaking all the rules
\espaceInterStrophe

So come on, come on
Come on, come on
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
Lets get the TV and the radio
To play our tune again
Its 'bout time we got some airplay
Of our version of events
There's no need to be afraid
I will sing with you my friend
\espaceInterStrophe

Come on, come oooon
\end{Verse}

\begin{Bridge}
Yeah we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
Now we're finally finding our voices
So take a chance, come help me sing this
\espaceInterStrophe

Yes we're all wonderful, wonderful people
So when did we all get so fearful?
And now we're finally finding our voices
Just take a chance, come help me sing this
\end{Bridge}

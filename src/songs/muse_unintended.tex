\begin{Song}{Unintended}{Muse}

\begin{Verse}
You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You could be the one I'll always love
\espaceInterStrophe

You could be the one who listens
To my deepest inquisitions
You could be the one I'll always love
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
First there was the one who challenged
All my dreams and all my balance
She could never be as good as you
\espaceInterStrophe

You could be my unintended
Choice to live my life extended
You should be the one I'll always love
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
\espaceInterStrophe

I'll be there as soon as I can
But I'm busy mending broken
Pieces of the life I had before
Before you
\end{Chorus}

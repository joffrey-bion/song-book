\begin{Verse}
And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
But then it seems that I
Had seen it in her eyes
\espaceInterStrophe

Though it might not be wise
I'd still have to try
With all the love I have inside
I can't deny
\espaceInterStrophe

I just can't let it die
Cause her heart's just like mine
And she holds her pain inside
\espaceInterStrophe

So if you ask me why
She wouldn't say goodbye
I know somewhere inside
\espaceInterStrophe

There is a special light
Still shining bright
And even on the darkest night
She can't deny
\end{Verse}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Chorus}
So if she's somewhere near me
I hope to God she hears me
There's no one else could ever
Make me feel I'm so alive
\espaceInterStrophe

I hoped she'd never leave me
Please God you must believe me
I've searched the universe
Found myself within' her eyes
\end{Chorus}
\espaceInterStrophe

\begin{Verse}
No matter how I try
They say it's all a lie
So what's the use of my
Confessions to a crime
Of passions that won't die
In my heaaaaaaaaaaaaart

\begin{Verse}
And now I don't know why
She wouldn't say goodbye
It just might be that I
Had seen it in her eyes
And now it seems that I
Gave up my ghost of pride
I'll never say goodbye aaaaaeeeeye
